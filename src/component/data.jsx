          Flowbite is first conceptualized and designed using the Figma software
          so everything you see in the library has a design equivalent in our
          Figma file.

    content: (

        <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
          The main difference is that the core components from Flowbite are open
          source under the MIT license, whereas Tailwind UI is a paid product.
          Another difference is that Flowbite relies on smaller and standalone
          components, whereas Tailwind UI offers sections of pages.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400">
          However, we actually recommend using both Flowbite, Flowbite Pro, and
          even Tailwind UI as there is no technical reason stopping you from
          using the best of two worlds.
